## Rules of play

A game of bowling consists of ten frames. In each frame, the bowler will have two chances to knock down as many pins as
possible with their bowling ball. In games with more than one bowler, as is common, every bowler will take their frame
in a predetermined order before the next frame begins. If a bowler is able to knock down all ten pins with their first
ball, he is awarded a strike. If the bowler is able to knock down all 10 pins with the two balls of a frame, it is known
as a spare. Bonus points are awarded for both of these, depending on what is scored in the next 2 balls (for a strike)
or 1 ball (for a spare). If the bowler knocks down all 10 pins in the tenth frame, the bowler is allowed to throw 3
balls for that frame. This allows for a potential of 12 strikes in a single game, and a maximum score of 300 points, a
perfect game.
